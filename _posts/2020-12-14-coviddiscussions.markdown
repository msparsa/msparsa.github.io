We analyzed posts from January to May 2020 across various subreddits to uncover how the pandemic affected online communities. We identified key discussion hubs beyond dedicated COVID-19 forums, including general Q&A (r/AskReddit), teen spaces (r/teenagers), and advice forums for medical, mental health, relationship, and legal issues. Using topic modeling, we found recurring themes: fear of infection, job insecurity, loss of motivation, struggles with online life, and frustration with non-compliance to social distancing. These insights reflect the profound personal and social disruptions faced by Reddit users during the early pandemic.
