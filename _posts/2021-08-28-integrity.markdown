We examined Reddit discussions on academic subreddits from Fall 2019 and Fall 2020 to understand studentsâ€™ feelings about online cheating. We found a threefold increase in cheating-related posts in 2020, shifting from plagiarism in programming (pre-COVID) to broader online assessment concerns during the pandemic. We identified three unique themes in 2020: cheating inflates grades, prompting tougher exams; unpunished cheating demotivates students; and unclear integrity policies confuse them.
