We explored the relationship between climate change discussions on Reddit and the COVID-19 pandemic across subreddits. Before the pandemic, we observed steady conversations focusing on skepticism, consequences, and solutions, tied to events like the Paris Agreement. After COVID-19 hit, we noted a shiftâ€”discussions in r/climateskeptics grew more doubtful, linking lockdowns to reduced emissions as "proof" against climate urgency, while r/climateOffensive and r/environment pivoted to pandemic-driven solutions like remote activism and economic recovery tied to green initiatives, amplifying both division and innovation in climate discourse.
