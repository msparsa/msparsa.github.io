In this study, we analyzed tweets to understand public attitudes toward climate action during the pandemic, contrasting with our Reddit study’s broader pre- and post-COVID scope. Unlike the Reddit findings, where we saw a split between heightened skepticism and solution-focused shifts, here we found a stronger tilt toward optimism, with over 60% of tweets supporting climate action in recovery, like sustainable infrastructure and cycling, despite unique concerns about public transit’s COVID-19 risks. We also identified a distinct theme absent from Reddit: lessons from the pandemic, such as global collaboration and science-driven policy, shaping future climate strategies, though skeptics still echoed doubts seen on Reddit, now tied to economic recovery debates.
