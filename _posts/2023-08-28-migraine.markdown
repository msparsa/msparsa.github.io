We explored Reddit discussions to highlight public misunderstandings about migraines and their impact on migraineurs. Migraines are a serious condition affecting all ages, triggered by diverse factors like stress or caffeine, disproportionately impact women (especially during menstruation or pregnancy), and worsened during COVID-19 due to intensified attacks and lockdown stress. These findings, drawn from subreddits like r/migraine and r/AskWomen, reveal unique social and gender dynamics absent from our environmental studies, emphasizing personal struggles over policy debates.
