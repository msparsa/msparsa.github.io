We studied Nsp15, a SARS-CoV-2 endoribonuclease crucial for immune evasion and a promising drug target. Despite its complex structure, we screened 2640 acrylamide compounds, finding 10 that inhibited Nsp15 activity (IC50 < 5 μM) with favorable properties like low molecular weight and Lipinski compliance. Using this data, we built an AI model with 73% accuracy to predict new inhibitors, showing acrylamide fragments’ potential for Nsp15 drug development.
