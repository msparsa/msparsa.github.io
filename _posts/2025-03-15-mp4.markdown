We introduce MP4, a transformer-based AI model that generates novel protein sequences from functional text prompts. Trained on a diverse dataset of 138,000 tokens and 3.2 billion data points, MP4 creates proteins with specified functions like binding or catalysis, achieving high structural stability and experimental success. We tested over 1,000 unique prompts, producing sequences with natural amino acid distributions and predicted foldability (average pLDDT 82.6). Experimentally, 84% of 94 selected sequences expressed well in a cell-free system.
