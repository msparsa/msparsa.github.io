We introduce **SIMBA**, a graph neural network framework augmented by metabolic simulations to decode microbiome dynamics. Unlike traditional methods focusing only on taxonomic abundance, SIMBA builds biologically grounded graphs by simulating pairwise interactions using metabolic networks, capturing metabolite cross-feeding and functional links between microbes.

Our edge-aware attention GNN is trained through a multi-stage pipeline that includes self-supervised learning, simulation-based pretraining, and fine-tuning on real microbiome abundance data. SIMBA achieves state-of-the-art performance (Spearman œÅ = 0.85) and delivers interpretable insights into keystone taxa and metabolic bottlenecks, highlighting the synergy between systems biology and deep learning for precision microbiome analysis.
